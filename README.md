# Credit-Risk-Classification

In this Challenge, I will use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. For this challenge, I will be splitting the aata into training and testing sets, creating a logistic regression model with the original data, and writing a credit risk analysis report.
